// Genkit development server entry point.
// AI features have been removed, so this file is minimal.
// It might be kept for potential future use if a different toolkit is added.

// Ensure this file can import your flows if they were previously here for dev purposes
// For example:
// import './flows/your-flow-name';


// Genkit dev server would pick up flows defined with ai.defineFlow()
// automatically from the imported files.
