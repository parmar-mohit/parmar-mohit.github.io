    "content": "React Hooks have fundamentally changed how we write components in React. Introduced in React 16.8, they allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. This post will explore some of the most commonly used hooks and advanced patterns.\\n\\n## useState\\nThe `useState` hook is the most basic hook and allows you to add state to functional components.\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\\n\\nfunction Counter() {\\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\\n        Click me\\n      </button>\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## useEffect\\nThe `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in functional components. It's a close replacement for `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in class components.\\n\\nExample: Fetching data\\n```jsx\\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\\n\\nfunction UserData({ userId }) {\\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\\n\\n  useEffect(() => {\\n    fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`)\\n      .then(response => response.json())\\n      .then(data => setUser(data));\\n  }, [userId]); // Dependency array\\n\\n  if (!user) return <p>Loading...</p>;\\n  return <p>User: {user.name}</p>;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## useContext\\n... (content continues) ...\\n\\nThis is just a brief overview. Hooks offer much more, including `useReducer`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and the ability to create custom hooks. Mastering them is key to modern React development."
